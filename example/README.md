# sbt-eta Example Project

This project showcases a setup between Eta and Scala that you are free to use as a
template.

## Description

This project has two components: a Scala project and an Eta project. The Scala 
component will read from a file (`src/main/resource/data.json` generated by
[Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com)) that has a json object on each line. Each line
will be sent over to the Eta component via FFI which will process it and return the
result back to Scala. Scala will then generate a file called `output.json` which will
be created wherever you have invoked `sbt run`.

## Running

To compile & run the project:

```shell
sbt run
```
